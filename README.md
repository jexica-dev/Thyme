# Project Overview

## Thyme

An interactive website/app where you comment in your yearly goals, new beliefs/positive affirmations, and new ideas.

## Project Description

Thyme is a goal-setting, affirmation, playful, info-graphic tree that and encourages you to make time to visualize your dreams. You're able to post or edit new ideas, new dreams, new affirmations. You're able to bump up the priority of whichever goal on the organized, thyme-line page.

### MVP/PostMVP

<!-- The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion. -->

#### MVP

- Create an API using Airtable.
- User will add an affirmation to the form and the message will appear on the home page.
- Post (leaf) view and delete.

#### PostMVP

- Add second API for about page with thyme information.
- Add some animations.
- User can give posts a thyme (thumbs) up.

## SWOT Analysis

<!-- // add 1-2 sentences of reflections. -->

### Strengths:

Concept, interactivity, and creativity.

### Weaknesses:

Completing the React / Actual code / offset grid in the background faster.

### Opportunities:

Creating a unique take at new year resolutions, goal setting. There's an opportunity to animate the divs in javascript to make the leaves move.

### Threats:

Not being able to have enough time to complete the MVP.
